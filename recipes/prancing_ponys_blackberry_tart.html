        <h2>Desription</h2>
        <p class="quote">
            "There was hot soup, cold meats, and a blackberry tart, new loaves, 
            slabs of butter, and half a ripe cheese: good plain food, as good 
            as the Shire can show, and homelike enough to dispel the last of 
            Sam’s misgivings (already much relieved by the excellence of the 
            beer)."

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Crust</p>
        <ul>
            <li>250g / 2 cups – All purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp – salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp – granulated sugar</li>
            <li>160g / 1 stick + 1 tbsp – cold, unsalted butter</li>
            <li>10g – vegetable shortening</li>
            <li>115g – ice cold water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pastry Cream</p>
        <ul>
            <li>340g milk</li>
            <li>3 large yolks</li>
            <li>45g granulated sugar</li>
            <li>15g all purpose flour</li>
            <li>15g cornstach</li>
            <li>1tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pint fresh blackberries</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine your four, salt, sugar, and 
                shortening.  With your fingers, or in a stand mixer with a 
                paddle attachment, work the shortening into the flour.  You’ll 
                want the shortening to create a clumpy sand texture with the 
                flour. Next, add your cold butter.  Slicing the butter will 
                help incorporate into the flour easier but cubes of butter will 
                work as well.  Work the butter into the flour until it creates 
                hazelnut size pieces.  Add the ice cold water and mix just 
                until the flour is hydrated.  Wrap with plastic wrap and place 
                it into the refrigerate for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare your pastry cream by heating the milk on 
                medium heat until it comes to a simmer.  In mixing bowl, 
                combine your egg yolks, vanilla extract, sugar, salt, flour, 
                and cornstarch.  Mix until combined.  Once the milk comes to a 
                simmer, pour a quarter of it into the yolk mixture.  
                Immediately stir to combine. Continue to temper the yolks with 
                the hot milk.  Once that is done, pour the mixture back into 
                the pot over medium heat.  Continue to whisk the mixture as it 
                thickens.  Let it come to a boil for a minute or two to ensure 
                that the flour has been cooked through.  Strain and cover 
                directly with plastic wrap.  Place it into an ice bath and let 
                it cool down.</li>
            <li>While the pastry cream is cooling, preheat your oven to 350F 
                and place your dough on a lightly floured surface.  Cut the 
                dough into five equal pieces.  Take one piece and roll it out.  
                Try to keep it as rectangular as possible or with whatever 
                shape you are deciding to use.  Transfer the dough into the 
                tart pan and gently press in the edges and corners.  Dock with 
                a fork and continue the same process with the rest of the 
                tarts.  Bake at 350F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.  
                Let the tart shells cool after baking.</li>
            <li>Once the pastry cream is cool, loosen it with a spatula or in a 
                mixing bowl with a paddle attachment.  If you find the cream is 
                too thick, you can loosen it with heavy cream.  Fill the tart 
                shells with the cream and garnish with sliced blackberries.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Notes: Make sure to bake your tarts until it is golden brown 
            because that will help ensure the crust will hold up to the pastry 
            cream over time.  Some use an apricot glaze to layer the bottom to 
            help with that issue.
