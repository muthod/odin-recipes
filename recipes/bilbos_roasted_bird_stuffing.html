            "Sorry! I don't want any adventures, thank you. Not Today. 
            Good morning! But please come to tea -any time you like! Why not 
            tomorrow? Good bye!"
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>sage to taste or about 4 sprigs</li>
            <li>one egg</li>
            <li>giblets</li>
            <li>celery finely chopped</li>
            <li>chicken broth enough to bind and hydrate breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>a clove of garlic finely chopped</li>
            <li>pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Saut√© the giblets (neck, heart, and gizzard) in 1 tbsp of 
                vegetable oil on medium heat for approximately 5-10 minutes to 
                brown on all sides.</li>
            <li>Add enough water or chicken stock to cover the giblets by 2 
                inches and let it simmer for 30-45 minutes or until tender.</li>
            <li>Let the giblets cool before chopping and adding to the rest of 
                the ingredients.  Remember to pull the meat off the neck.</li>
            <li>Combine all ingredients in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Prep you bird by seasoning the outside with salt and pepper.  I 
                created a butter and sage mixture to go in between the skin and 
                the breast meat of the chicken.  This helps create a crisper 
                and more flavorful skin.</li>
            <li>Stuff the bird with the stuffing while making sure not to pack 
                it in too tightly.  You will run the risk of food poisoning if 
                the stuffing is not cooked through to 165F.  It is a safer 
                option of cook the stuffing on the side instead of stuffing it 
                in the bird.</li>
            <li>Tie the bird together with twine to keep the legs and wings 
                together and roast at 375F for approximately 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Check the temperature at the center of the bird to determine if 
                it is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Let it rest before slicing. Serve with some vegetables and a 
                good drink.</li>
        </ol>
