        <p class="dialog">Merry: Don’t know why he’s so upset!  It’s only a 
            couple of carrots.</p>
        <p class="dialog">Pippin: and some cabbages and those few bags of 
            potatoes that we lifted last week. And the mushrooms the week 
            before.</p>
        <p class="dialog">Merry: Yes Pippin, my point is, he’s clearly over 
            reacting! Run!</p>
