            "Lembas, Elvish waybread. One small bite is enough to fill the 
            stomach of a grown man."

            Lembas translates to journey bread and has said to leave a man 
            filled for an entire days journey. This waybread is supposedly 
            tastier than cram and the recipe was closely guarded and was only 
            given to outsiders once, the fellowship.

            The leaves from the Mallorn tree in Lothlorien wraps and keeps the 
            lembas fresh for days if kept unbroken. Mallorn trees grew in 
            Lothlorien and the leaves turned gold in the autumn.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 stick 12T - butter, soften</li>
            <li>1/2 cup - brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup - honey</li>
            <li>2 - eggs large</li>
            <li>1 T - orange blossom water</li>
            <li>2 cups - all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup - almond meal</li>
            <li>1 - lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 T - vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/3 cup - sliced almonds</li>
            <li>6 - banana leaves large</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 360F.</li>
            <li>Cream together the softened butter, sugar, and honey.</li>
            <li>Add your orange blossom water, vanilla extract, and lemon zest. 
                Mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Add one egg at a time and scrape the batter in between each 
                addition.</li>
            <li>Add your four and almond meal in two to three additions. Scrape 
                in between each addition.</li>
            <li>Add almond slices and mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap. Keep the dough 1/2" thick and 
                square to make it easier to cut later.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for 30-40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the dough is firm, cut it into 2"x3" rectangles, it should 
                be 1/2" thick. My leaves are 14" in length and 11" in width. If 
                your leaves are bigger or smaller, cut your leaves 
                accordingly.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease your baking pan. You can keep the lembas fairly 
                close together since these are not going to spread.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20-30 minutes. It should be firm and light golden 
                brown. Let these cool before wrapping.</li>
        </ol>
