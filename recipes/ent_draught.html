        <h2>Desription</h2>
        <p>
            Merry and Pippin have awaken and started to drink the water the 
            nourishes Fangorn Forest.  The water not only healed their wounds 
            and made them feel refreshed, it also made them taller.  Merry and 
            Pippin were the tallest hobbits because of this and supposedly they 
            were a whopping 3 inches taller than other hobbits.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 - large seedless cucumber</li>
            <li>1 - granny smith apple</li>
            <li>6 - leaves of fresh mint</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp - honey</li>
            <li>5 oz - sparkling water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Juice your cucumber and apple in a juicer.  I left the skin on 
                just because a lot of the nutrients are in the skin.</li>
            <li>Combine your mind leaves, honey, and a few tablespoons of your 
                fresh use to a cocktail muddler. Muddle the ingredients until 
                the mint leaves release all it's goodness.</li>
            <li>Now strain out the mint leaves and add in the rest of the 
                juice.  Top it off with some sparkling water and garnish with 
                some fresh mint. You can adjust the sweetness with more honey 
                and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
